# 5-stage-RISCV-Processor-Design
Implementation of 5-stage pipelined RISC-V 32 base ISA processor.

RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles.
We designed a 5 stage, pipelined RISC-V 32 base ISA processor in Verilog.
